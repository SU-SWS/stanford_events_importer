The Stanford Events Importer provides custom functionality for importing from events.stanford.edu XML feeds. A new feed API is available that is customized to work with this importer. It is available at: http://events.stanford.edu/xml/drupal/
(See http://events.stanford.edu/xml/ for more information on feeds.)

Note: The master branch is empty. Please check out the appropriate branch (6.x-1.x, 7.x-1.x) for your version of Drupal core.
